# c11db

A database connection library using C++11 features.

With the use of variadic templates, type-safe database queries can be made
using C++11. This library tries to make use of this feature and provide an
interface to multiple database backends.

## Installation

c11db uses [cmake][cmake] to build and install the library, and comes with a
unix makefile to automatically setup the cmake build. To build you can either
do a raw cmake build `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..` or have the makefile
do the work for you: `make install`.

## Using

*coming soon*

## License

This library is distributed under the Apache v2.0 license, so you may use and
modify the library.
